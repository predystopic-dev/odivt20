# Odi & T20i Comparison

Just a jupyter notebook and some ball by ball data from cricsheets.org I am using to compare a t20i inning and last 20 overs of an odi inning.

Ignore all the files, just use the jupyter notebook to play around. If you want, you can change implementations of aggregator files that's bringing data from json over to numpy arrays.
